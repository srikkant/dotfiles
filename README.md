# srikkant's dotfiles

this repository contains all dotfiles I require for setting up a new system.
right now, it is a very simple set of defaults for my two devices - linux & osx.

#### install the following tools:

- **zsh**: shell
- **stow**: config management
- **wezterm**: terminal
- **nvim**: editor
- **lf**: file explorer
- **starship**: shell prompt
- **fzf**: fuzzy finder
- **antidote**: plugin manager (install to home)
- **zoxide**: jump to directories

finally, you'll need to run the `stow` to setup the config:

```
stow ~ .
```
